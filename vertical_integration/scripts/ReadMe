# For the user, the script that will be more useful is "aspen_to_heron.py".

# other scripts are intermediate steps (from the Aspen outputs to the HERON XML file).

# These intermediate steps can be helpful if the user wants to verify that the code works properly.

# Inside each script are examples (commented) to help the user understand how the code works.
